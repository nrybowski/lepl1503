    In this exercise, we will work with operation on bits. When we speak about the position of a bit, index 0 corresponds to lowest order bit, 1 to the second-lowest order bit, ...

    In C source code, you can write a number in binary (base 2) by prefixing it via 0b., e.g. 0b11010 = 26.

    This exercise will introduce some non-standard data types which guarantee that the variable has a fixed number of bits. Indeed, on some machines, a *int* could use 2, 4 or 8 bytes. Hence, if we want to perform bitwise operations, we have to know first on how many bits we are working.

    For this, C introduces a new class of variable types :

    - *int8_t* (signed integer of 8 bits)
    - *uint8_t* (unsigned integer of 8 bits)
    - *uint16_t* (unsigned integer of 16 bits)

    You can mix *uint* or *int* with bit-lengths 8, 16, 32 and 64). These types are defined in <stdint.h>

            Write the body of a function *cycle_bits*, which cycles all bits from *n* places to the left, according to the formula *x[(i+n)%32] = x[i]*, where *x[i]* is the i-iest bit of *x*.

            Here is a simple example with bytes. Consider byte ``0b01101011``. If ``n`` is set to ``1``, then ``cycle_bits`` would return ``0b11010110``. If ``n`` is set to ``4``, then ``cycle_bits`` would return ``0b10110110``.
