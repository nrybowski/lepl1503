    When you execute a C program, its function ``main()`` is called with, as parameters, the name of the program and the arguments after the executable's name.

    The signature of the ``main()`` function **must** be the following :

    .. code-block:: c

        int main(int argc, char **argv)

environment_id: cpp
environment_parameters:
    limits:
        memory: '100'
        hard_time: ''
        time: '30'
    run_cmd: ''
environment_type: docker

            Write a complete C program containing a *main*. Your program should print one argument out of two (starting with the first), and return 0. Each argument shall be separated by a space, and the output shall be terminated by a new line just after the last argument printed (so without any additional space). **Don't forget the required includes for your program.**

            Example :

            .. code-block:: bash

                ./myProg a b c d e f g
                a c e g
        default: ''
        type: code
