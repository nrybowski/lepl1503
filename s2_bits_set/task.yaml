    In this exercise, we will work with operation on bits. When we speak about the position of a bit, index 0 corresponds to lowest order bit, 1 to the second-lowest order bit, ...

    In C source code, you can write a number in binary (base 2) by prefixing it via 0b., e.g. 0b11010 = 26.

    This exercise will introduce some non-standard data types which guarantee that the variable has a fixed number of bits. Indeed, on some machines, a *int* could use 2, 4 or 8 bytes. Hence, if we want to perform bitwise operations, we have to know first on how many bits we are working.

    For this, C introduces a new class of variable types :

    - *int8_t* (signed integer of 8 bits)
    - *uint8_t* (unsigned integer of 8 bits)
    - *uint16_t* (unsigned integer of 16 bits)

    You can mix *uint* or *int* with bit-lengths 8, 16, 32 and 64). These types are defined in <stdint.h>

            Write the body of a function that returns the value of variable *x*, but modified with the bit at position *pos* set to *value*.

            Remember that in C (this is defined in stdbool.h), ``true`` corresponds to integer ``1`` while ``false`` corresponds to integer ``0``.

            Remember than in C, you can create a mask as a binary value and use it with the bitwise ``and`` (``&``) and ``or`` (``|``) operations. For example:

            .. code-block:: c

               uint8_t a=0b00000000;
               uint8_t b=0b00001000;
               uint8_t c=0b11111101;
               uint8_t d=0b11011011;
               // ~(a) returns 0b11111111
               // (c&a) returns 0b00000000
               // (c&b) returns 0b00001000
               // (a|b) returns 0b00001000
               // (d&c) returns 0b11011001


            .. code-block:: c

                #include <stdint.h>
                #include <stdbool.h>
                /*
                 * @pre 0<= pos < 64
                 */
                uint64_t set_bit(uint64_t x, int pos, bool value) {
        default: ''
